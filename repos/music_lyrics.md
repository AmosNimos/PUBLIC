~~~
indoctrination of the nation
disinformation on television

That's 
the tyranny that where used to!
A tyranny that where numb to!

Why refuse to see the reality, for sake of fantasy.
deselusion like religion, belive what you wish to believe.
dismissal of reason, for blissfull ignorance.
drown in fear and push to hate.
ignoring the scuicide rate.

Mass manipulation
cognitive disonance
state of confusion
induced obediance

political agenda
behevioral conditioning
invisible propaganda
constant brainwashing !

mass paranoia 
mass histeria

big data and the media

maybe some of us are paranoid but some of us are right to be.

denial of reality

condecending to the warning
YOUR NOT EVEN LISTING!

discrimination force injection
suppression and deletion 

everything is fine, no need to worry
it's gonna be fine!
